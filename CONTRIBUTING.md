# Reconmap

Contributors are more than welcome. This guidelines exist to make sure we collaborate on the most efficient way possible. Depending on what your contribution is you might want to speak to the development team before doing anything. The guys are generally available on the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/reconmap/community) for the project.

Contributors can add themselves to the [credits](CREDITS) in the same pull requests that includes their changes or separately. If the contribution is not in the form of code we can add the contributor's name to the CREDITS file for them.

## Contributing guidelines

- If you are contributing with code, make sure you have forked the project, and created a pull requests that contains amongst other things a description of your changes.
- The [editor config file](.editorconfig) file, when used by your editor or IDE, should format your changes in adherence to our coding standards.
- Ideally you should add unit test coverage to your changes, but this is not mandatory for certain changes.
